# Hi there, I'm Kaitlynne

honest and direct

Being a _Jill-of-all-trades_, I've worn designer, technical writer, accountant, business operations, and marketer hats while working at
Merus, Inc. What started as a part-time position while working my way through college as an office manager/administrative assistant
changed and grew into a _catch all_ position for multiple roles. Since graduating UC Berkeley in 2013, I tested the waters in the
_real world_ for my major and worked with a great architecture firm working with single and multi-family housing.

The draw the architecture always consisted of the desire to be challenged, creative, and to problem solve within a given set of constraints.
Working in the architecture field addressed this, but I realized that i missed working in a fast-paced startup environment and I missed
being surrounded by tech. Thankfully, Merus welcomed me back full-time. From there I taught myself HTML and CSS off the clock and applied
those skills in the office by taking on redesigning 

fun facts:
I like my coffee strong and black, but indulge in a soy latte now and again.
UC Berkeley alum, an avid reader with the occasional Netflix binges. When I'm off the clock you can find me
grabbing good food with great friends, attempting to be outside as much as possible, and getting in a workout by running or lifting.

I seek structure where the goals of a project or tasks are clearly defined, but love having my own little playpen to try out new
skills and produce work that I and my team will be proud of. 

Bay Area native
knack for design
background in Architecture

I thrive when entrusted with projects, both large and small, with clear requirements and goals and rise to the opportunity
of having more responsibility and ownership in my career. 

My unique background in studying architecture and design at UC Berkeley combined with my experience wearing multiple hats
while filling roles ranging from designer to developer at Merus, Inc. have given me a clear perspective on the intricacies
the role of Web Developer requires.
