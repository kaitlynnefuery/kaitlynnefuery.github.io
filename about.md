## Hi there, I'm Kaitlynne

<div class="col-sm-8">
Being a <em>Jill-of-all-trades</em>, I've worn designer, technical writer, accountant, business operations, and marketer hats while working at
Merus, Inc. What started as a part-time position while working my way through college as an office manager/administrative assistant
changed and grew into a position for multiple roles. Since graduating UC Berkeley in 2013, I tested the waters and worked with a
great architecture firm working with single and multi-family housing.
<br><br>
Although the architectural industry addressed my desire to be challenged, creative, and to problem solve within a given set of constraints,
I realized that I missed working in a fast-paced startup environment. Thankfully,
Merus welcomed me back full-time where I had the opportunity to teach myself HTML and CSS off the clock and apply
those skills in the office by taking on designing, developing, and deploying the company's external sites.
<br><br>
Today, I consider myself to be a unicorn; a Developer + Designer hybrid.

Cheers!
