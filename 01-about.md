Developer + Designer hybrid with 3+ years experience developing websites and user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Working in a startup environment for 8 years allowed me to wear many hats and have involvement in a wide range of positions.
From this experience, I harnessed my design background with a newfound love for developing usable web interfaces that guide
the user through the site and/or application.

In my downtime you can find me with a cup of coffee, brunching with close friends, traveling, or staying fit by running, lifting, or swimming.
