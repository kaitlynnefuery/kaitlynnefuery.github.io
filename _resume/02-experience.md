## Merus, Inc.

_Front-End Web Developer, June 2008 - April 2016_

Working at Merus for 8 years allowed me to wear many hats and experience a wide range of positions within a fast-paced startup
environment. During my tenure, I harnessed my previous experience of design with a newfound love for developing usable web interfaces
that guide the user through the site and/or application.

While serving as a Web Developer & Designer, I worked cross-functionally with the Sales, Marketing, and Customer Support teams to create and
implement external web-based content including the main company website, as well as branding and support subdomains. Towards the end of my
time at Merus, I worked with the QA team in developing an automatic test suite for the application as well as contributed to bug fixes for
each two-week release cycle. 

Previous roles included Marketing Coordinator, Accounting & Operations, Product Trainer, and On-boarding Consultant.
