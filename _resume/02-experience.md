## Merus, Inc.

<i class="fa fa-map-marker" aria-hidden="true"></i> OAKLAND, CA

_June 2008 - April 2016_

Working at Merus for 8 years allowed me to wear many hats and experience a wide range of positions within a fast-paced startup
environment. During my tenure, I harnessed my previous experience of design with a newfound love for developing usable web interfaces
that guide the user through the site and/or application.

While serving as a Web Developer & Designer, I worked cross-functionally with the Sales, Marketing, and Customer Support teams to create and
implement external web-based content including the main company website, as well as branding and support subdomains. Towards the end of my
time at Merus, I worked with the QA team in developing an automatic test suite for the application as well as contributed to bug fixes for
each two-week release cycle. 

Previous roles included Marketing Coordinator, Accounting & Operations, Product Trainer, and On-boarding Consultant.

### Select Projects

#### MerusCase 4.0 Documentation

_Project Lead, December 2015 - February 2016_

Served as project lead to organize, write, review, and deploy written content for every feature in the new 4.0 version of the application.
Guides were written in markdown, generated as static html pages using Jekyll, and automatically published to
[docs.meruscase.com](http://docs.meruscase.com){:target="_blank"} when a series of tests successfully ran in CirclCi.

#### QA Testing for MerusCase Application

_January 2016 - Aprl 2016_

Support the Dev team's 2 week release cycles through conducting manual test plans, logging issues within GitHub, manually verifying tickets
marked as "Resolved", and contributing to the creation of an automated test suite written in Ruby that utilizes both xpath and css selectors.
Handled minor bug fixes within the application relating to cross browser functionality, responsive design, and UI refinement written in
JavaScript, Less, and Sass.

#### Branding Website

_Web Developer & Designer, November 2015 - April 2016_

Created [branding.meruscase.com](http://branding.meruscase.com){:target="_blank"} which consists of static html pages generated by Jekyll
that uses GitHub Pages to automatically deploy changes pushed upstream to the master branch. 

#### External Website Design & Development

_Web Developer & Designer, June 2013 - April 2016_

Fully redesigned and  implemented the current website, [meruscase.com](http://www.meruscase.com){:target="_blank"}, to appeal to a broader
client base in conjunction with revamping brand identity. Redesign included site organization, creation of written marketing content,
creation of graphics in both .png and .svg format via Illustrator, and moving over existing knowledge base from Blogger to GetSimple.  

Updated CSS to include @media queries at custom breakpoints in response to Google's Mobilgeddon in January 2015.
